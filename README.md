# Identicon

Cool Elixir GitHub-like identicon generator.

## How to run this app locally

* Clone the repo
* run `mix deps.get`
* run `mix test`
* You should see a your_name.png file created in the root of your project.

```
## Generate docs

- Run `mix docs`
- Open `/docs/index.html`

Refer to the hex docs' own documentation to learn how you can generate an ePub file of the docs.


Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/identicon](https://hexdocs.pm/identicon).
